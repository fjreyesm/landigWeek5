      <p>
      I consider myself a mafia leader by nature, with the ability to manipulate the psychology of my opponents and recruit new allies. By my side my partners are their pale reflection, they seem cruel, petty, or trivial and brutish. I have all the poise to be The Godfather. I am wise, intelligent, cognitive, and through my eloquence I am able to convince without the need for bullets. My personal lifestyle, which is the most outstanding virtue.
      Although I am a rough and tumble criminal, I am also a loving father and loving husband. My tenderness is the paradox that makes me an exceptional being.

        Don Vito is a master at creating a loyal community that supports him if something goes wrong. The relationships that he maintains with the outside allow him to maintain his power, regardless of whether those relationships give him a benefit or not. The creation of strategic alliances is essential in a business context such as the current one.

For that he shows loyalty, as we see in the birth of his figure in the US, and he knows how to earn respect. A slow process but one that gives results and that is related to its next quality

            America, 1940s. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the respected and feared boss of one of New York's five mafia families. 
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            He has four children: Connie (Talia Shire), the impulsive Sonny (James Caan), the pushy Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino), who wants nothing to do with his father's business. 
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            When Corleone, against the advice of 'Il consigliere' Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), refuses to participate in the drug trade, another gang boss orders his murder.

            After struggling all his life, he is tired and pins all his hopes on finding a successor to take over the business. Vincent, the illegitimate son of his brother Sonny, seems to be the chosen one.
