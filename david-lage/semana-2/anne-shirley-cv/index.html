                    <p class="about-me-contents">
                        I was born in Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia, Canada, the daughter of Walter and Bertha Shirley. My parents passed away when I was a few days old and I was later taken in by the Thomas family. Several years later, she was taken in by Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert of Avonlea, Prince Edward Island, who were expecting a boy to help with the farm.<br>
                        <br> I attended the local school in Avonlea, where I became friends with Diana Barry, Ruby Gillis and Jane Andrews, who later formed the Story Club, and met Gilbert Blythe and Charlie Sloane. I later attended Queen's Academy with Ruby, Jane and Gilbert to train as a teacher, and it was here that I became friends with Priscilla Grant.
						After Matthew passed away, Anne went back to Marilla and gave up my scholarship to Redmond College to stay by Marilla's side while she battled her eyesight. I became Davy and Dora Keith's guardian when Marilla took in the twins after her mother Mary died. When autumn came, I started teaching at the Avonlea school. Initially I found it daunting to teach my former classmates, but I soon found my niche and became a highly respected teacher.
						<br>
						<br>
						After saving enough money and feeling reassured by Marilla's improved health, I moved to Kingsport, Nova Scotia to attend Redmond College with my old friends Jane, Gilbert, and Charlie. After various adventures and misadventures, I graduated from Redmond College.

                              After graduating from Redmond and getting engaged to Gilbert, I decided to accept an offer to teach at Summerside High School. On September 11, 1887, I and Mrs. Rachel Lynde went to Summerside to find a place to stay. After three years of teaching at Summerside Secondary School I returned to Avonlea.

                        <br> Also, I am a devoted, passionate friend and the most idealistic soul in history. And, of course, I am also a loving and caring mother with my children.
