      <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump. My momma always said miracles happen
        every day. I figure the same rule applies to gettin' a job! So I'm
        lookin' to become the president of the US of A. I may not be the
        smartest man as I spent most o' my time in college playin' football, but
        I reckon it's the same idea as runnin' for presidency: just hope for the
        best and never stop runnin'! I've already met three of the old
        presidents, which was real nice, specially all the Dr Peppers. I've seen
        that president with the orange face on the television who people don't
        seem to like too much. I think I could do that. Lieutenant Dan says I'm
        crazy, but who'd ever have thought he'd get magic legs? Stranger things
        have happen'd!
