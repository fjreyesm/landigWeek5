Personal Profile
My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump. My momma always said miracies happen every day. I figure the samerule applies to gettin' a job! So I'm lookin' to become the president of the US of A. I may not be the smartestman as I spent most o my time in college playin' football, but I reckon it's the same idea as runnin' forpresidency: just hope for the best and never stop runnin'! I've aiready met three of the oid presidents, whichwas real nice, especially all the Dr Peppers. I've seen that president with the orange face on the televisionwho people don't seem to like too much. I think I could do that. Lieutenant Dan says I'm crazy, but who'dever have thought he'd get magic legs? Stranger things have happen'd!
